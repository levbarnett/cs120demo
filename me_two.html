        <div>
            <p>Over spring break, I went to Myrtle Beach, SC with the Tufts frisbee team. After months and months
                of the Medford/Somerville chilly weather,<br>it was amazing to spend the week on a beach. The whole
                week was blissfully warm, even when it rained. Although Myrtle Beach isn't the nicest area<br>and it
                didn't have a lot going on, it was heavenly to just sit in the sun all day.

            My <strong>favorite restaurant</strong> is <a href="https://www.nijiyasushi.net/" target="_blank">Nijiya</a>
            in Medford because their sushi is ready quickly, but it's still delicious.<br>They have rolls that
            that I could eat for days, which is good because the restaurant is all-you-can-eat!
