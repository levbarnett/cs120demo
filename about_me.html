        <h1>Lev Barnett</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Over spring break, I went to Myrtle Beach, SC with the Tufts frisbee team. After months and months
                of the Medford/Somerville chilly weather,<br>it was amazing to spend the week on a beach. The whole
                week was blissfully warm, even when it rained. Although Myrtle Beach isn't the nicest area<br>and it
                didn't have a lot going on, it was heavenly to just sit in the sun all day.
            </p>

            <p>My Favorite Pet Names:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Greyhound dog named Stuart</li>
                <li>A turtle named Davis</li>
                <li>A fish named Bubbles</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            My <strong>favorite restaurant</strong> is <a href="https://www.nijiyasushi.net/" target="_blank">Nijiya</a>
            in Medford because their sushi is ready quickly, but it's still delicious.<br>They have rolls that
            that I could eat for days, which is good because the restaurant is all-you-can-eat!

            <p>&lt;- My <strong>favorite food:</strong> a big juicy burger. I usually aim for medium in terms of cooking level,<br>
            and I love tomatoes, <strong>pickles!!!!</strong>, and some onions (although unlike the person who took <br>
            this picture, I prefer mine grilled).<br clear="left"></p>
